<h3>What We Collect</h3>
In order to provide you with the best experience possible, we here at PicMe Games do collect some information about you. This information includes:
<ul>
<li>First and Last name- Your name is saved in our database so we can display your account information on your device.</li>
<li>Email- Since you have the option to add content to the Snaption community, we do save the email address you provide for a Snaption account.</li>
<li>Whether you use an iOS or Android device- Since we want to provide the same content for both iOS and Android devices, we save whether your device is an iOS or Android device.</li>
<li>Facebook identification number- If you decide to log into Snaption using Facebook, we save your Facebook identification number to ensure we properly link your Facebook account to Snaption.</li>
<li>Facebook or Google+ username- In the event you decide to contribute content to Snaption, we want to make sure you get the credit you deserve. In order to make sure you get credit, we save your Facebook or Google+ username so we can display with the content you create. If you decide, you can change your username to your name or to something entirely different. We remove your old username as soon as it is replaced.</li>
<li>Facebook or Google+ profile picture- In a game about pictures, we want to make sure you have your own! We save your Facebook or Google+ profile picture in order to attach it and your username to the content you create.</li>
<li>The games you create- Since Snaption is open to anyone to create content, it might be harder to find the games you create. In order to help you out, we save what games you create and put them in an easy-to-explore section on your personal profile. This way, you can always find what you have created nice and quick.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Are Your Options</h3>
In this day and age, accounts for preserving your information associated with each online service we use. While we offer the same service in order to ensure you can create content for the Snaption community and get the credit you deserve, you can also opt out of sharing the information discussed above by not creating an account with us. We understand you might not want to provide us with some information, and we don’t want to penalize you for that choice. You will still be able to browse content within the Snaption community without providing us any information.

<h3>How Can You See What We Collect</h3>
If you decide to log in to Snaption, you can see some of the information on your personal profile page. This information includes your name, username, profile picture, and games you create. In order to prevent some of your other information such as email, device type, and Facebook identification number for getting into the wrong hands, we don’t make that information publicly available and keep it stored in our database.

<h3>How We Are Protecting Your Information</h3>
Your information is important to us. So we do all we can to protect that information. For all data exchanged between you device and our services, we use HTTPS to ensure your data is safely encrypted while in transit to its destination—whether its login information, pictures, captions, or notifications. On top of that, the access to your information is limited to our internal technology professionals improving our database, and they will not access your personal information without consulting you first.
